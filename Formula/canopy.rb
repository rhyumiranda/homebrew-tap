# Homebrew formula for the Canopy CLI (build-from-source bash, no compile).

# CANONICAL COPY, versioned + reviewed here. The PUBLISHED tap lives at
# rhyumiranda/homebrew-tap as Formula/canopy.rb — mirror every change there.
# The url/sha256 bump on each release is documented in
# packaging/homebrew/README.md (the sha256 can only be computed after the tag
# exists, so it is a PLACEHOLDER here and the publisher fills it in).

  def install
    # Stage the whole CLI under libexec, then put `canopy` on PATH via a symlink.
    # bin/canopy follows its readlink chain to find lib/: the PATH symlink ->
    # libexec/bin/canopy resolves to the real file, and CANOPY_ROOT climbs one
    # dir to libexec, where lib/ and the def sources sit alongside bin/. So lib/
    # loads correctly through the brew symlink (test/bin_symlink_test.sh covers
    # the chained-symlink resolution).
    #
    # commands, hooks, skills, and dist are REQUIRED: first-run auto-wire and
    # `canopy setup --link` copy the Claude/Codex defs from $CANOPY_ROOT (here
    # the Cellar libexec). Omit them and auto-wire finds nothing and silently
    # wires zero defs.

    <<~EOS
      Canopy — an orchestration layer for AI coding agents.

      brew installs the CLI only. Three prereqs are NOT on Homebrew — install
      them separately:
        - claude (Claude Code, v2.1+)  https://code.claude.com/docs
        - treehouse (worktree pool)    https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse
        - gh-axi (GitHub CLI wrapper)
      Run `canopy doctor` to check every prereq and its version.

      Claude/Codex agent defs wire automatically on first run (idempotent) —
      the formula ships the def sources (commands, hooks, skills, dist) so the
      first `canopy` run can copy them into ~/.claude and ~/.codex.

      macOS merge-watcher (optional): canopy watch install

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/canopy --version")
